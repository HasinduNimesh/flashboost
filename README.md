## 💻 Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Create a Module**: Organize your learning by subject area (e.g., "Spanish Language", "Data Science")
2. **Add Decks**: Within modules, create decks for specific topics (e.g., "Spanish Verbs", "Machine Learning Algorithms")
3. **Create Flash Cards**: Add flash cards to decks with front (question) and back (answer) content
4. **Study**: Begin study sessions with intelligent spaced repetition to optimize retention

### Study Techniques

FlashBoost implements a modified version of the SuperMemo SM-2 algorithm for spaced repetition:

- **Again**: Card will appear again in the same session
- **Hard**: Card will reappear after a shorter interval
- **Good**: Card will follow the standard spaced repetition interval
- **Easy**: Card will have an extended interval before reappearing
